    ~ About:
        This is my own implementation of the 'pixd' command orinally design
        by FireyFly; I think i achived it even tho i wanted to make some
        animations, but they were not implemented since the output is too
        big sometimes, so i thought it would not be worth it...

        This program can be used with any type of file since all what the
        program is doing is reading the bytes of the file itself, so the
        program can be used to color and make art somehow.
